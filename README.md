# Project Title

This dependency was created just for fun and should NOT be in a production environment.

It was purely created for me willing to go through the whole process of creating a library. The implementation of the code was a simple challenge took from reddit, and it's probably bad. For more details, check the acknowledgments bellow.

## Getting Started

```
npm i upc-check-digits-reddit
```

### Importing


```
let upcCheck = require('upc-check-digits-reddit')
```

### How to use it ?

Pretty straightforward :

```
if(upcCheck("042100005264"))
    console.log("It's a valid code !")
```
